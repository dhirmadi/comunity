# Contributing — Spec-First Workflow

1. Start with specs:
   - Add/modify FRDs in `/specs/FRD.md` and NFRs in `/specs/NFR_SLO.md`.
   - Record decisions in `/governance/DECISIONS.md`.
2. Open issues using templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
3. Implement only after specs approved.
4. In PRs, reference FR‑IDs and decisions; confirm acceptance criteria.
5. Keep safety/privacy constraints intact; add monitoring hooks where relevant.
