— Outputs —

— Rules —
- No TBDs; each endpoint includes request/response examples.
- Auth: cookie sessions; CSRF on state change.
- Error envelope unified across endpoints.
- Only MVP scope endpoints unless explicitly asked to extend.

— Workflow —
1) Extract schemas from DDL; define components/schemas.
2) Define endpoints for auth, profiles, groups, posts, comments, follows, reports.
3) Validate spec; list assumptions and open questions.
