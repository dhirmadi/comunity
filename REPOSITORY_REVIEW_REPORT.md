## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Spelling and Grammar Errors

**File:** `docs/productinformation/Carya_ProductBrief.md` (FIXED)
- **Issue:** ~~Filename had typo - should be "ProductBrief" not "Productbief"~~ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue:** Multiple spelling errors throughout document
- **Impact:** ~~Undermines professional credibility~~ **IMPROVED**

**File:** Multiple files
- "dosc" instead of "docs" in problem statement and various references
- "comunity" vs "community" inconsistency in repository name and references
- "sucggestions" instead of "suggestions" in problem statement

### 2. Inconsistent Terminology

**Throughout documentation:**
- "Carya" vs "Community Platform" - needs consistent branding
- Date formats vary (2025-09-26 vs other formats)
- Status indicators inconsistent (Pending/In-Progress/Review/Done vs other formats)

### 3. Incomplete Documentation

**File:** `specs/FRD.md` (only 48 lines)
- Missing detailed functional requirements for most features
- Limited acceptance criteria details
- No traceability matrix as promised

**File:** `specs/NFR_SLO.md` 
- Referenced but contains minimal content
- Missing performance targets, availability requirements
- No error budget definitions

### 4. Structural Issues

**File:** `docs/productinformation/Carya_Document_Create_TODO.md`
- All tasks marked as "Pending" but document suggests work has been done
- Dependencies not clearly tracked
- No progress indicators or completion estimates
